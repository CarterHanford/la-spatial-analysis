### Introduction

This is the public repository for homework 1 of SOC5670, Spatial Demography. Homework 1 asks us to perform an analysis on a city or metropolitan region of our choice, implementing different spatial statistical techniques to study a data set of our choosing. Data for this project was obtained from [Social Explorer](www.socialexplorer.com) and cleaned using [Rstudio](www.rstudio.com). Maps were created in [ArcPro](pro.arcgis.com) and [GeoDa](https://geodacenter.github.io/). 

Some of the statistical techniques used in this spatial analysis include:

* Mean Center / Standard Distance / Directional Distribution
* Univariate Moran's I
* Bivariate Moran's I
* Spatial Autocorrelation (single variable)
* BiLISA (Bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Association)

### Repository Contents

* The `data` folder houses all of the data that was used to complete this project, including raw data, clean data, and shapefiles.
* The `docs` folder includes the R notebooks that were used to clean the original data before sending it off to ArcPro.
* The `maps` folde contains all of the maps that homework 1 asked us to generate, as well as a few tables.
* The `spatial statistics` folder includes all of the spatial statistics that were calculated from homework 1.
